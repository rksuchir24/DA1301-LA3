Git gives developers the freedom to try, test, and experiment safely through branching and version control. This makes the development process more flexible and ensures a smooth programming experience.

## Which Python assignment problem did you enjoy the most?
The Prime Code Breaker problem in Lab Assignment 2 was my favourite as I particularly enjoyed refining and optimizing the code through repeated iterations to improve its efficiency.
